# Get Started

## Quick Start with Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by
clicking the link:

[![](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Markdown%20powered%20docs%20site.%20Built%20with%20Next.js.&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2Fdemo.png&demo-title=Documentation%20Starter%20Kit&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2F&project-name=nextjs-docs&repository-name=nextjs-docs&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra&from=templates)

Vercel will create the Nextra repository and deploy the site for you with just a
few clicks. Once done, every change in the repository will be deployed
automatically.

> Any `.md` or `.mdx` file will turn into a doc page and be displayed in

> to style elements inside `theme.config.js`.
