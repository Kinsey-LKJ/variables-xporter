# Other design variables

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

In a design system, besides colors, typography, and spacing, there are many other important design variables. Let's look at how to organize these variables to maintain consistency and maintainability in the design system.

## Other styles

### Responsive breakpoints

Use `breakpoint` or `screens` as the top-level directory:

- `breakpoint/sm`
- `breakpoint/md`
- `breakpoint/lg`

- `screens/sm`
- `screens/md`
- `screens/lg`

### `border-radius`

Use `border-radius` or `radius` as the top-level directory:
- `border-radius/sm`
- `border-radius/md`
- `border-radius/lg`

- `radius/sm`
- `radius/md`
- `radius/lg`

### `filter:blur()`

Use `blur` as the top-level directory:
- `blur/sm`
- `blur/md`
- `blur/lg`

You can view the complete list of configuration keys in the [Tailwind CSS theme configuration reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#theme-variable-namespaces).

## Component-level variables

For component-level variables, the top-level directory should still follow the principles in this document, but the component name should be used as the second layer, for example:
- `colors/button/DEFAULT`
- `colors/button/foreground`
- `colors/button/border`

- `colors/input/DEFAULT`

- `colors/card/DEFAULT`
- `colors/card/foreground`
- `colors/card/border`
