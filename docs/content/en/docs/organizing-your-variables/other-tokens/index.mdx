# Other Design Variables

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

In a design system, beyond colors, typography, and spacing, there are many other important design variables. Let's explore how to organize these variables to maintain design system consistency and maintainability.

## Other Styles

### Responsive Breakpoints
Use `breakpoint` or `screens` as the top-level directory:

- `breakpoint/sm`
- `breakpoint/md`
- `breakpoint/lg`

or:
- `screens/sm`
- `screens/md`
- `screens/lg`

### `border-radius`

Use `border-radius` or `radius` as the top-level directory:
- `border-radius/sm`
- `border-radius/md`
- `border-radius/lg`

or:
- `radius/sm`
- `radius/md`
- `radius/lg`

### `filter:blur()`

Use `blur` as the top-level directory:
- `blur/sm`
- `blur/md`
- `blur/lg`

You can find a complete list of configuration keys in the [Tailwind CSS Theme Configuration Reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#theme-variable-namespaces).

## Component-level Variables

For component-level variables, still follow the principles in this documentation for the top-level directory, but use the component name as the second level, for example:
- `colors/button/DEFAULT`
- `colors/button/foreground`
- `colors/button/border`

- `colors/input/DEFAULT`

- `colors/card/DEFAULT`
- `colors/card/foreground`
- `colors/card/border`
