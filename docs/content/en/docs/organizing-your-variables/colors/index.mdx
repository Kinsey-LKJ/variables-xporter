# Color System

The color system is perhaps the most important part of Design Tokens. If you're unsure about organizing and naming color variables, [shadcn/ui's naming convention](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming#convention) is a great starting point:
Generally, `background` is used for background colors, `foreground` for text colors, and when `background` is used for component background colors, such as `colors/card/DEFAULT`[^1], the `background` suffix is omitted. From this foundation, you can gradually expand to more variables.

## Top-level Directory
Please use `colors` or `color` as the top-level directory for all color-related variables. This not only makes your variable structure clearer but also ensures perfect compatibility with Tailwind CSS.

## Opacity Modifiers

Variables Xporter provides powerful color processing capabilities, automatically generating color variables that [comply with Tailwind CSS rules](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables). During development, you can easily adjust color transparency using opacity modifiers without needing additional variable definitions.

```html
<!-- Text opacity adjustment -->
<div class="text-primary/80">Text with adjusted opacity</div>
<div class="text-secondary/60">Text with adjusted opacity</div>

<!-- Background opacity adjustment -->
<div class="bg-primary/10">Background with adjusted opacity</div>
<div class="bg-accent/90">Background with adjusted opacity</div>

<!-- Border opacity adjustment -->
<div class="border-2 border-primary/30">Border with adjusted opacity</div>
```
