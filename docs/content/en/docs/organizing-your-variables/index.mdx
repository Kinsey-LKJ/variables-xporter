# Organizing your design variables

Facing the increasingly complex needs of Design Tokens management, Variables Xporter recommends using the [single outlet principle](/docs/single-outlet-principle) to organize your variable system. Proper variable organization not only improves the quality of exported code, but also makes complex multi-mode design systems clear and manageable.

## Basic principles

Before you start organizing variables, we've prepared some practical advice and best practices for you. These principles will help you establish a robust and flexible variable system:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Organization principles"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/principles"
  />
</Cards>

The basic principles cover the core elements of variable organization, including naming conventions, hierarchical structures, grouping strategies, and other key content. These principles will help you build a clear variable system.

## Variable Type Organization Strategies

Different types of design tokens require corresponding organization strategies. Here are organization guides for common design token types:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Palette />}
    title="Color system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/colors"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Typography system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/typography"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Ruler />}
    title="Spacing and sizing system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/spacing"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Box />}
    title="Other tokens"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/other-tokens"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Moon />}
    title="Multi-mode"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/multi-mode"
  />
</Cards>

## Organization essentials

### Collection design

Organize collection structure according to the [single outlet principle](/docs/single-outlet-principle):

- **Main collection**: Contains all externally provided variables, serving as the unified outlet
- **Mode collections**: Only store variables that need to change in different modes
- **Reference relationships**: Connect main collection and mode collection variables through references

### Naming conventions

- Strictly follow Tailwind CSS configuration key structure
- Use slash `/` for variable grouping
- Properly use the `DEFAULT` keyword for base values, facilitating clear variable hierarchy

### Practical tips

- Regularly check variable structure to ensure clear reference relationships
- Add descriptions to important variables for team understanding
- Avoid overly complex nested structures
- Maintain consistency and predictability in naming

By adopting these organization strategies, you can effectively manage complex Design Tokens and build a design system that is both powerful and maintainable.
