# Properly organize your Figma Variables

Facing increasingly complex Design Tokens management needs, Variables Xporter recommends using the [Single Outlet Principle](/docs/single-outlet-principle) to organize your variable system. A well-structured variable organization not only enhances the quality of exported code but also makes complex multi-mode design systems clear and easy to manage.

## Basic principles

Before you start organizing variables, we've prepared some practical suggestions and best practices. These principles will help you build a robust and flexible variable system:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Organization principles"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/principles"
  />
</Cards>

The basic principles cover the core elements of variable organization, including naming conventions, hierarchical structure, grouping strategies, and other key content. These principles will help you build a clear variable system.

## Variable type organization strategies

Different types of design tokens require corresponding organization strategies. Here are organization guidelines for common design token types:

  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Palette />}
    title="Color system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/colors"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Typography system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/typography"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Ruler />}
    title="Spacing and sizing system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/spacing"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Box />}
    title="Other tokens"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/other-tokens"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Moon />}
    title="Multi-mode"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/multi-mode"
  />
</Cards>

## Key organization points

### Collection design

Organize collection structures according to the [Single Outlet Principle](/docs/single-outlet-principle):

- **Main collection**: Contains all externally provided variables, serving as a unified outlet
- **Mode collections**: Only store variables that need to change across different modes
- **Reference relationships**: Connect corresponding variables between the main collection and mode collections through references

### Naming conventions

- Strictly follow Tailwind CSS configuration key structure
- Use slash `/` for variable grouping
- Properly use the `DEFAULT` keyword for base values, facilitating clear variable hierarchy

### Practical tips

- Regularly check variable structure to ensure clear reference relationships
- Add descriptions to important variables for team understanding
- Avoid overly complex nested structures
- Maintain consistency and predictability in naming

By adopting these organization strategies, you can effectively manage complex Design Tokens and build a design system that is both powerful and maintainable.

## Figma Variables Template

We provide a Figma Variables template, including colors, spacing, fonts, and other variables, with support for multiple modes including theme, brand, device, and density modes, and can be perfectly exported as Tailwind CSS or CSS Variables.
