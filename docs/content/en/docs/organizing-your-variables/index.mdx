# Organizing your design variables

Welcome to the variable organization guide! In a design system, the way variables are organized is like the foundation of a building â€” it not only enhances the efficiency of design and development, but for projects using Tailwind CSS, it also determines whether design tokens can be correctly exported and used. Let's explore together how to build a clear and efficient variable system.

## Why variable organization matters

- **Maintainability** âœ¨: A clear variable structure allows team members to easily find and update the required design tokens, like a well-organized toolbox
- **Scalability** ðŸŒ±: A good organization method provides a solid foundation for future design system expansion, allowing the system to evolve gracefully as the project grows
- **Consistency** ðŸŽ¯: Unified naming and classification ensure the consistency of design language across the entire product, making the user experience more uniform and professional
- **Efficiency** âš¡: Reasonable variable organization can accelerate design and development workflows, reducing communication costs
- **Tailwind compatibility** ðŸ”„: The variable structure needs to be as consistent as possible with Tailwind CSS's configuration structure to ensure correct export and mapping

## Basic principles

Before you start organizing variables, we've prepared some practical advice and best practices for you. These principles will help you establish a robust and flexible variable system:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Organization principles"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/principles"
  />
</Cards>

These suggestions can help you:
- Establish a variable naming method suitable for your team, making the code more readable
- Plan a clear variable hierarchy to improve maintainability
- Enhance the maintainability and scalability of variables to adapt to project growth
- Correctly match Tailwind CSS's configuration structure to ensure seamless integration

## Variable types

After understanding the basic principles, let's delve into how to organize different types of variables. Each type has its specific organization strategy and best practices:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Palette />}
    title="Color system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/colors"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Typography system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/typography"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Ruler />}
    title="Spacing and sizing system"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/spacing"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Box />}
    title="Other tokens"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/other-tokens"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Moon />}
    title="Multi-mode"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/multi-mode"
  />
</Cards>

## Practical tips

Here are some proven suggestions that can help you better organize and manage variables:

- Choose an appropriate naming convention based on team habits and maintain consistency
- Organize the variable structure according to project requirements, avoiding excessive complexity
- Strictly follow Tailwind CSS's configuration structure (this is mandatory)
- Add clear descriptions to variables to help the team understand usage scenarios
- Regularly check and optimize variable organization, adjusting unreasonable aspects promptly
- Document in detail the usage scenarios and best practices for important variables
- Make good use of collections to categorize variables, improving maintainability
- Ensure variable names can be correctly parsed when exported, avoiding conflicts


Remember, good variable organization is like an excellent housekeeper, it can make your design system run more smoothly and make team collaboration more efficient. Let's start this exciting journey of variable organization!
