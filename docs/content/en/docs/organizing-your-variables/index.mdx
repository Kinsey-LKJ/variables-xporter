# Properly Organize Your Figma Variables

Well-organized Figma Variables are essential for optimal export quality and maintainable design systems. Learn our proven organization methodology, including the [Single Outlet Principle](/docs/organizing-your-variables/single-outlet-principle), to manage complex multi-mode variables effectively.

## Foundation Principles

Master these core principles to build robust, scalable variable systems that work seamlessly with Variables Xporter:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Variable organization principles"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/principles"
  />
</Cards>

These principles cover essential elements including naming conventions, hierarchical structure, and grouping strategies that ensure your variables export cleanly and maintain consistency across your design system.

## Design Token Organization Strategies

Different Design Token types require specific organization approaches. Follow these proven strategies for each token category:

  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}

  <Cards.Card

    title="Spacing system"

    title="Other Design Tokens"

  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Moon />}

    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/multi-mode"
  />
</Cards>

## Key organization points

### Collection design

Organize collection structures according to the [Single Outlet Principle](/docs/organizing-your-variables/single-outlet-principle):

- **Main collection**: Contains all externally provided variables, serving as a unified outlet
- **Mode collections**: Only store variables that need to change across different modes
- **Reference relationships**: Connect corresponding variables between the main collection and mode collections through references

### Naming conventions

- Strictly follow Tailwind CSS configuration key structure
- Use slash `/` for variable grouping
- Properly use the `DEFAULT` keyword for base values, facilitating clear variable hierarchy

### Practical tips

- Regularly check variable structure to ensure clear reference relationships
- Add descriptions to important variables for team understanding
- Avoid overly complex nested structures
- Maintain consistency and predictability in naming

Following these organization strategies ensures your Design Tokens are maintainable, scalable, and export perfectly every time.

## Figma Variables Template

We provide a Figma Variables template, including colors, spacing, fonts, and other variables, with support for multiple modes including theme, brand, device, and density modes, and can be perfectly exported as Tailwind CSS or CSS Variables.
