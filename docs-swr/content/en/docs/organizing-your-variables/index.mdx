# Organizing Your Design Variables

Welcome to the variable organization guide! In a design system, how you organize variables is like laying the foundation of a building â€” it not only enhances design and development efficiency but, for Tailwind CSS projects, also determines whether design tokens can be correctly exported and used. Let's explore how to build a clear and efficient variable system.

## Why Variable Organization Matters

- **Maintainability** âœ¨: A clear variable structure allows team members to easily find and update design tokens, like a well-organized toolbox
- **Scalability** ðŸŒ±: Good organization provides a solid foundation for future design system expansion, allowing the system to evolve gracefully as the project grows
- **Consistency** ðŸŽ¯: Unified naming and categorization ensure design language consistency across the entire product, creating a more unified and professional user experience
- **Efficiency** âš¡: Rational variable organization can accelerate design and development workflows, reducing communication costs
- **Tailwind Compatibility** ðŸ”„: Variable structure needs to align with Tailwind CSS's configuration structure as much as possible, ensuring correct export and mapping

## Basic Principles

Before organizing variables, we've prepared some practical suggestions and best practices. These principles will help you establish a robust and flexible variable system:

  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Organization Principles"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/principles"
  />
</Cards>

These suggestions will help you:
- Establish team-friendly variable naming conventions for more readable code
- Plan clear variable hierarchies to improve maintainability
- Enhance variable maintainability and scalability to adapt to project growth
- Correctly match Tailwind CSS's configuration structure for seamless integration

## Variable Types

After understanding the basic principles, let's explore how to organize different types of variables. Each type has its specific organization strategies and best practices:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Palette />}
    title="Color System"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/colors"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Type />}
    title="Typography System"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/typography"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Ruler />}
    title="Spacing and Size System"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/spacing"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Box />}
    title="Other Tokens"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/other-tokens"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Moon />}
    title="Multi-mode"
    href="/docs/organizing-your-variables/multi-mode"
  />
</Cards>

## Practical Tips

Here are some proven tips that can help you better organize and manage variables:

- Choose naming conventions that suit your team's habits and maintain consistency
- Organize variable structure according to project needs, avoiding over-complexity
- Strictly follow Tailwind CSS's configuration structure (this is mandatory)
- Add clear descriptions to variables to help team members understand use cases
- Regularly review and optimize variable organization, adjusting inefficiencies promptly
- Document important variable use cases and best practices in detail
- Make good use of Collections to categorize variables, improving maintainability
- Ensure variable names can be correctly parsed during export, avoiding conflicts

Remember, good variable organization is like having an excellent butler - it makes your design system run more smoothly and team collaboration more efficient. Let's begin this exciting journey of variable organization!
