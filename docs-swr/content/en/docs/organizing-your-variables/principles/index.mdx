# Organization Principles

When using Variables Xporter, how you organize variables directly affects the quality of the exported results. Let's learn how to properly organize variables in Figma to ensure the exported code perfectly fits your development environment.

## Naming Principles

To make variables more understandable and maintainable, we recommend following these naming principles:

- Use English names: This ensures compatibility with development environments and maintains consistency when variables are exported to Tailwind CSS configurations or CSS variables
- Choose semantic naming: Variable names should clearly express their purpose, making them instantly understandable to team members
- Keep it concise: Avoid overly long or complex naming, making code more readable and maintainable

## Top-level Names
If your project uses Tailwind CSS, ensure that variable top-level names match Tailwind CSS's theme configuration keys. Here are some common configuration keys:

- `colors`
- `spacing`
- `fontSize`
- `fontWeight`
- `borderRadius`
- `opacity`

You can find a complete list of configuration keys in the [Tailwind CSS Theme Configuration Reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#configuration-reference).

## Separation Principles
In design systems, we often need multiple words to describe a variable. Variables Xporter will automatically convert naming formats during export based on the target format:

- Tailwind CSS configuration files: Uses camelCase format (e.g., fontSize, fontWeight)
- CSS variables: Uses kebab-case format (e.g., font-size, font-weight)

Here are some common naming formats for reference:
- camelCase -> twoWords
- constantCase -> TWO_WORDS
- kebabCase -> two-words
- pascalCase -> TwoWords
- pascalSnakeCase -> Two_Words
- snakeCase -> two_words
- trainCase -> Two-Words
- capitalCase -> Two Words
- sentenceCase -> Two words

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  When exporting variables, regardless of which format you use above, Variables Xporter will automatically convert the output to formats that comply with or are required by Tailwind CSS configuration files and CSS variables:
  - Tailwind CSS configuration files: Uses camelCase format (e.g., fontSize, fontWeight)
  - CSS variables: Uses kebab-case format (e.g., font-size, font-weight)
</Callout>

## Grouping Principles
Proper variable grouping can greatly improve work efficiency. We recommend using the `/` symbol to organize variable hierarchies, just like managing a file system:

Imagine how difficult it would be to find files if they were all piled in your computer's root directory. Similarly, we need to create clear hierarchical structures for variables:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="colors" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="primary" />
    <FileTree.File name="secondary" />
    <FileTree.File name="tertiary" />
    <FileTree.File name="..." />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

These correspond to the following variables in Figma:

- `colors/primary`
- `colors/secondary`
- `colors/tertiary`

### Using the `DEFAULT` Keyword to Organize Variable Hierarchies
The `DEFAULT` keyword serves a dual purpose: it can set default values, and more importantly, it can unify the levels of variables at the same hierarchy, making variable management clearer and more systematic. Let's look at a specific example:

- `colors/primary`
- `colors/primary/foreground`

This is a common set of variables, used for the primary color and text color on the primary color, but this naming alone is not enough. Let's think about it in terms of file management:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="colors" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="primary" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="primary" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="foreground" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Here we encounter an interesting challenge: although logically, the variables `colors/primary` and `colors/primary/foreground` should be in the same directory, they are actually scattered in different locations. Let's see how this appears in Figma:

<figure className="mt-6">
  <>![Cannot find the `colors/primary` variable in the colors -> primary directory](/organizing-your-variables/organizing-your-variables-1.png)</>
  <figcaption>
    Cannot find the `colors/primary` variable in the colors -> primary directory
  </figcaption>
</figure>

To find the `colors/primary` variable, you need to go to the colors directory:

<figure className="mt-6">
  <>![Find the `colors/primary` variable in the colors directory](/organizing-your-variables/organizing-your-variables-2.png)</>
  <figcaption>
    Find the `colors/primary` variable in the colors directory
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Think about how troublesome it will become to find the `colors/primary` variable as we have more and more variables, **because we can't rely on the left sidebar for quick location, but have to search in the colors directory**.
This situation not only affects our work efficiency, more importantly, when we try to convert this structure to Tailwind CSS V3 configuration, we'll encounter a technical limitation: **JavaScript objects don't allow the same key to be used as both a value and an object**.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1117
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: 'var(--colors-primary)', 
        primary: {
          foreground: 'var(--colors-primary-foreground)',
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Don't worry though, Tailwind CSS provides us with an elegant solution — using the `DEFAULT` keyword:
```ts twoslash
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: 'var(--colors-primary)',
          foreground: 'var(--colors-primary-foreground)',
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

The best part is that in actual development, you don't need to write out the `DEFAULT` keyword at all. Tailwind CSS will handle this detail automatically, keeping your code concise:

```html
<div class="text-primary">
  <p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>
```

With this technique, we can elegantly organize our variables in Figma. Just use `DEFAULT` as a marker for default values:

- `colors/primary/DEFAULT` - Default value for primary color
- `colors/primary/foreground` - Text color on primary color

They will then appear in the same directory:

<figure className="mt-6">
  <>![Organize variable hierarchy using default values](/organizing-your-variables/organizing-your-variables-3.png)</>
  <figcaption>
    Organize variable hierarchy using default values
  </figcaption>
</figure>
