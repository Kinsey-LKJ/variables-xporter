# Tailwind CSS V4

Tailwind CSS has introduced V4, bringing many new features and improved performance. When choosing the Tailwind CSS V4 export mode, Variables Xporter will generate one file:

- `app.css` - Contains all Tailwind CSS configuration and CSS variables

## Features and Optimizations

### 1. Color Value Optimization

Automatically converts color values to oklch format, supporting opacity modifiers:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: oklch(0.94 0.024 17.6);
}
```

Usage example:

```html
<div class="text-primary/80">
  <!-- 80% opacity -->
  Hello World
</div>
```

### 2. Typography Style Merging

Automatically merges related typography style variables, following Tailwind CSS V4 conventions:

```css
@theme {
--text-lg: 1.125rem;
--text-lg--line-height: 1.75rem;
}
```

### 3. Multi-mode Support

Through **variable tracing** and the **Single Outlet Principle**, Variables Xporter can implement complex multi-mode variable exports.

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: var(--color-red-500);
}

@layer theme {
  .dark {
    --color-primary: var(--color-red-400);
  }
}
```

### 4. Powerful Compatibility
Variables Xporter supports both Tailwind CSS V3 and V4 export modes, and one set of Figma variables can seamlessly switch between the two export modes without any changes. Variables Xporter will automatically adjust the export based on different version naming conventions.

## Variable Organization Guide

To ensure perfect export of Figma variables, variable naming needs to follow certain rules as it needs to correspond with Tailwind CSS configuration keys. Additionally, good variable organization brings many benefits:

- Improves variable maintainability
- Maintains design system consistency
- Facilitates team collaboration

### Basic Principles
You can first understand the basic principles of variable organization, which will help you make better decisions regarding variable naming, grouping, and hierarchy.
