# Unit Conversion

Variables Xporter provides unit conversion functionality that automatically converts px units from Figma to rem units, which are preferred in Tailwind CSS.

## How to Use
1. Check the "Use Rem Units" option when exporting
2. Variables Xporter will automatically convert px to rem (based on 16px = 1rem)

For example:
```css
:root{
/* Values in Figma */
--spacing-lg: 24px;
--font-size-base: 16px;

/* Exported values (with rem conversion enabled) */
--spacing-lg: 1.5rem;    /* 24/16 = 1.5 */
--font-size-base: 1rem;  /* 16/16 = 1 */
}
```

## Variables Not Converted
Not all variable values are converted to rem. Here are the exceptions:

- Variables that are not of type `Number`
- Variables with names containing `px`, e.g., `spacing/px`, will not be converted to rem
- When a variable's value is a number but typically doesn't include units, it won't include any units in the generated CSS (e.g., opacity, scale)

All numeric variables except those meeting the above conditions will be converted when "Use Rem Units" is checked.

## rem or px?
This is quite a debated topic. Although Tailwind CSS has become a standard in web development and uses rem units by default, both rem and px have their pros and cons.
We recommend reading [Josh Comeau's article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) and making a decision based on your project's requirements and your development team's preferences.
